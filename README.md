# Predicting-House-Prices
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates house rent prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to assist tenants, landlords, and real estate agencies in making informed decisions by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Tools used
-Pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib.pyplot
-seaborn
-scipy.stats
-Sklearn
- *Evaluation* using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
 
# Prediction
- These help you measure your model’s accuracy:
 - If SSE, MSE, or RMSE are low, it means your model is predicting house prices well.
 - If they’re high, the model is making bigger mistakes
